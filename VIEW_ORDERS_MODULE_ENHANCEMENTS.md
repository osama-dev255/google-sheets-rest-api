- Advanced filtering by order status
- Real-time filtering as users type

### 3. Data Visualization
- Pie chart showing order status distribution
- Timeline view of recent order activities
- Summary cards with key metrics

### 4. Export Functionality
- One-click CSV export of all purchase orders
- Properly formatted data for external use

### 5. Refresh Capability
- Manual refresh button to update data
- Automatic refresh on navigation

### 6. Improved User Experience
- Better responsive design for all screen sizes
- Clear visual indicators for order status
- Intuitive navigation between views

## Integration with Existing System

### Updated Purchases Page
**File:** `frontend/src/pages/Purchases.tsx`

The Purchases page was updated to use the new ViewOrdersModule instead of the previous PurchaseOrderList component. The integration maintains all existing functionality while adding the new features.

### API Integration
The module continues to use the existing Google Sheets integration:
- Fetches data from the "Purchase Orders" sheet
- Uses the same data structure and mapping
- Maintains compatibility with existing backend endpoints

## User Interface Improvements

### View Mode Selection
Users can easily switch between different views using clearly labeled buttons:
- List View: Traditional table format
- Tracking View: Enhanced tracking with status badges
- Analytics View: Dashboard with charts and metrics

### Status Visualization
Enhanced status badges with color coding:
- Pending: Gray

- Ordered: Purple
- Shipped: Indigo
- Received: Green
- Cancelled: Outlined

### Data Export
Added export functionality to download order data as CSV:
- Preserves all order information
- Properly formatted for external use
- One-click download

### Refresh Capability
Added refresh button to update order data:
- Manual refresh on demand
- Visual feedback during refresh
- Error handling for failed refreshes

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies
The component uses the same dependencies as the previous implementation:
- React for UI rendering
- Lucide React for icons
- Recharts for data visualization
- Existing UI components from the component library

### Data Handling
- Maintains the same data structure as the previous component
- Groups items by order number for proper display
- Calculates order totals and item counts
- Generates mock tracking events for demonstration

### Performance Considerations
- Efficient filtering and search implementation
- Memoization of calculated values
- Conditional rendering based on view mode
- Proper error handling and loading states

## Testing and Verification

### Component Testing
The ViewOrdersModule was tested for:
- Proper rendering in all view modes
- Correct data display and filtering
- Functional export capability
- Responsive design across screen sizes

### Integration Testing
The component was tested within the Purchases page:
