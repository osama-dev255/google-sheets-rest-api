## How to Verify Deployment

### 1. Check Netlify Build

2. Check that the latest deployment was successful
3. Verify the build logs show no errors

### 2. Test Frontend Functionality

2. Go to the "Purchases" tab
3. Click "Add Stock Through Purchase"
4. Test the following scenarios:

#### Test Case 1: Missing Supplier

- Verify success message and data update in Google Sheets

### 3. Test Backend API
1. Use the test scripts we created to verify backend functionality:
   ```
   node test_add_stock_example.js
   node verify_supplier_change.js
   ```

## Rollback Plan
If issues are found after deployment:
1. Revert to the previous commit
2. Push the revert to GitHub
3. Monitor the redeployment
4. Fix the issues in a new branch
5. Deploy the fixed version

## Monitoring
After deployment, monitor:
1. Netlify build logs
2. Application error logs
3. User feedback
4. Google Sheets update consistency

## Success Criteria
Deployment is successful when:
1. Netlify build completes without errors
2. All validation scenarios work as expected
3. Backend API continues to function correctly
4. Data is properly updated in Google Sheets
5. No user-reported issues
