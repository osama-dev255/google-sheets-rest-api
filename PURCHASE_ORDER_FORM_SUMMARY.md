- **Numeric Field Handling**: Enhanced handling of numeric inputs (quantity, unit price) to ensure valid values
- **Better User Feedback**: Added success and error messages to improve user experience
- **UI/UX Enhancements**: Improved form layout and responsiveness with better spacing and organization

#### Technical Enhancements:
- Added `isSubmitting` state to track form submission status
- Added `submitError` state to handle and display submission errors
- Enhanced `updateItem` function to handle numeric field validation
- Improved `validateForm` function with comprehensive validation rules
- Enhanced `handleSubmit` function with loading states and improved error handling
