- **Enhanced Filtering**: Improved search and filter capabilities
- **Data Visualization**: Charts and summary cards for better insights
- **Export Functionality**: One-click CSV export of order data
- **Refresh Capability**: Manual refresh of order data
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all device sizes

#### Technical Details:
- TypeScript interface for PurchaseOrder and OrderTrackingEvent
- State management for search, filters, and view modes
- Integration with existing Google Sheets API
- Recharts library for data visualization
- CSV export functionality
- Proper error handling and loading states

### 2. Updated Purchases Page

**File:** `frontend/src/pages/Purchases.tsx`

#### Changes Made:
- Replaced PurchaseOrderList with ViewOrdersModule
- Maintained all existing functionality
- Updated import statements
- Preserved callback functions for order actions

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies
The component uses existing project dependencies:
- React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- UI components from '@/components/ui/'
- Lucide React icons
- Recharts for data visualization
- Existing services (apiService, currency utilities)

### Data Structure
Maintains compatibility with existing data structure:
- PurchaseOrder interface matching previous implementation
- OrderTrackingEvent interface for tracking data
- Same data mapping from Google Sheets

### Performance Considerations
- Efficient filtering and search algorithms
- Conditional rendering based on view mode
- Memoization of calculated values
- Proper error boundaries

## Testing and Verification

- Data display accuracy
- Filtering and search functionality
- Export capability
- Refresh functionality

## Benefits

### For Users:
- More comprehensive view of purchase orders
- Better data visualization and analytics
- Easier filtering and search
- Export capability for external use
- Improved tracking of order status

### For Developers:
- Modular component design
- Reusable code patterns
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to maintain and extend

### For Business:
- Better insights into purchasing patterns
