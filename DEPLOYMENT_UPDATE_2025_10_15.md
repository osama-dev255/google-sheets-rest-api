# Deployment Update - October 15, 2025

## Summary of Changes

Today we made critical updates to prepare the backend for deployment on Railway:

### 1. Created Backend Dockerfile
- Created a new [Dockerfile](file:///c:/Users/osama/Railway-Netlify%20Apps/Cloudhost/Railway%20Cloud%20hostV4/Dockerfile) in the root directory specifically for the backend application
- Configured multi-stage build process for optimal container size
- Set up proper build and runtime dependencies management

### 2. Updated Railway Configuration
- Modified [railway.json](file:///c:/Users/osama/Railway-Netlify%20Apps/Cloudhost/Railway%20Cloud%20hostV4/railway.json) to point to the correct Dockerfile path
- Changed from `frontend/Dockerfile` to `Dockerfile` to use our new backend-specific Dockerfile

## Files Modified

### New Files
1. **[Dockerfile](file:///c:/Users/osama/Railway-Netlify%20Apps/Cloudhost/Railway%20Cloud%20hostV4/Dockerfile)** - Backend Docker configuration with multi-stage build

### Updated Files
1. **[railway.json](file:///c:/Users/osama/Railway-Netlify%20Apps/Cloudhost/Railway%20Cloud%20hostV4/railway.json)** - Updated dockerfilePath to point to root Dockerfile

## Dockerfile Details

The new backend Dockerfile implements a two-stage build process:

### Build Stage
- Uses `node:18-alpine` as the base image
- Installs all dependencies including dev dependencies needed for building
- Copies source code and configuration files
- Runs TypeScript compilation with `npm run build`

### Production Stage
- Uses `node:18-alpine` as the base image
- Installs only production dependencies with `npm ci --only=production`
- Copies built files from the build stage
- Exposes port 3000
- Starts the server with `node dist/index.js`

## Railway Configuration Update

Updated the `railway.json` file to point to the correct Dockerfile:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "DOCKERFILE",
    "dockerfilePath": "Dockerfile"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "numReplicas": 1,
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10
  }
}
```

## Deployment Impact

These changes ensure that:

✅ **Backend will build correctly** on Railway's infrastructure
✅ **Smaller production containers** by using multi-stage build
✅ **Proper dependency management** with dev dependencies only during build
✅ **Correct Railway deployment** by pointing to the right Dockerfile
✅ **Optimized performance** with production-only dependencies in runtime

## Next Steps

1. **Push changes to GitHub** (already done)
2. **Trigger Railway deployment** 
3. **Set environment variables** in Railway dashboard
4. **Verify deployment** by testing API endpoints
5. **Monitor application logs** for any issues

## Testing the Deployment

After deployment, verify the backend is working correctly:

```bash
# Health check endpoint
curl https://YOUR_RAILWAY_APP_URL.railway.app/health

# API root endpoint
curl https://YOUR_RAILWAY_APP_URL.railway.app/

# Spreadsheet metadata
curl https://YOUR_RAILWAY_APP_URL.railway.app/api/v1/sheets/metadata
```

## Rollback Plan

If issues are encountered:

1. Revert the commit: `git revert a70d9ff`
2. Push the revert to GitHub: `git push origin main`
3. Railway will automatically redeploy the previous version
4. Investigate and fix the issues in a new branch
