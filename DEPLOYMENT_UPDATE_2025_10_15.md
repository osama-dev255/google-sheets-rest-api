## Dockerfile Details

The new backend Dockerfile implements a two-stage build process:

### Build Stage
- Uses `node:18-alpine` as the base image
- Installs all dependencies including dev dependencies needed for building
- Copies source code and configuration files
- Runs TypeScript compilation with `npm run build`

### Production Stage
- Uses `node:18-alpine` as the base image
- Installs only production dependencies with `npm ci --only=production`
- Copies built files from the build stage
- Exposes port 3000
- Starts the server with `node dist/index.js`

## Railway Configuration Update

Updated the `railway.json` file to point to the correct Dockerfile:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "DOCKERFILE",
    "dockerfilePath": "Dockerfile"
  },
  "deploy": {

## Next Steps

1. **Push changes to GitHub** (already done)
2. **Trigger Railway deployment** 
3. **Set environment variables** in Railway dashboard
4. **Verify deployment** by testing API endpoints
5. **Monitor application logs** for any issues

## Testing the Deployment

After deployment, verify the backend is working correctly:

```bash
# Health check endpoint
curl https://YOUR_RAILWAY_APP_URL.railway.app/health

# API root endpoint
curl https://YOUR_RAILWAY_APP_URL.railway.app/

# Spreadsheet metadata
curl https://YOUR_RAILWAY_APP_URL.railway.app/api/v1/sheets/metadata
```

## Rollback Plan

If issues are encountered:

1. Revert the commit: `git revert a70d9ff`
2. Push the revert to GitHub: `git push origin main`
3. Railway will automatically redeploy the previous version
4. Investigate and fix the issues in a new branch
