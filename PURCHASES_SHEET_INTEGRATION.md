# Purchases Sheet Integration

## Overview
The purchase endpoint has been enhanced to record all purchase transactions in the dedicated Purchases sheet in addition to updating the Inventory and Products sheets.

## Implementation Details

### New Functionality
When a purchase is submitted through the "Add Stock Through Purchase" form:
1. Inventory sheet is updated with new stock quantities
2. Products sheet is updated with new stock quantities and unit costs
3. A new record is added to the Purchases sheet with complete transaction details

### Purchases Sheet Structure
The Purchases sheet contains the following columns:
- ID: Unique purchase identifier
- RECEIPT NO.: Receipt number for the transaction
- DATE: Date of purchase
- TIME: Time of purchase
- PRODUCT: Name of the purchased product
- CATEGORY: Product category
- QUANTITY: Number of units purchased
- COST: Unit cost of the product
- AMOUNT: Total cost (quantity Ã— unit cost)
- LOCATION: Storage location of the product
- SUPPLIER: Name of the supplier
- STATUS: Transaction status
- PURCHASED BY: User who made the purchase

### Data Flow
1. Purchase data is received through the API endpoint
2. System looks up product information in both Inventory and Products sheets
3. Stock levels are updated in both sheets
4. A new row is appended to the Purchases sheet with:
   - Auto-generated ID and receipt number
   - Current date and time
   - Product information from Inventory/Products sheets
   - Purchase details from the request
   - System-generated status and user information

### Error Handling
If any part of the process fails:
- The entire transaction is rolled back
- An appropriate error message is returned
- No partial updates are made to any sheet

## Testing
A test script has been created to verify the functionality:
- `test_purchases_recording.js` - Verifies purchases are recorded correctly

## Benefits
- Complete audit trail of all purchase transactions
- Easy reporting and analysis of purchasing patterns
- Integration with existing financial tracking systems
- Improved inventory management through detailed transaction history

## Deployment
The enhancement has been committed and pushed to GitHub, which will trigger an automatic deployment to the production environment.
