# Products Page Update Documentation

## Overview
This document explains the changes made to the Products page to display all columns from your Google Sheets Products sheet.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Table Columns
The Products page table now displays all columns from your Google Sheets:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| ID | Product identifier from column A |
| Product | Product name from column B |

### 2. Enhanced Search Functionality

- Supplier name (new)
- Product ID (new)

### 3. Updated Filter Options
The filter dropdown now matches the actual status values in your Google Sheets:
- All (default)
- Active
- In-Active

### 4. Improved Status Display
The status badges now properly handle the exact values from your Google Sheets:
- "Active" → Green badge
- "In-Active" → Gray badge
- Any other status → Red badge with actual status text

## Data Mapping
The frontend continues to correctly map data from your Google Sheets:

| Google Sheets Column | Frontend Property | Data Type |
|---------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Column A (ID) | id | String |
| Column B (PRODUCT) | name | String |
| Column C (CATEGORY) | category | String |
| Column D (UNIT PRICE) | price | Number |
| Column E (UNIT COST) | cost | Number |
| Column F (STOCK) | stock | Integer |
| Column G (SUPPLIER) | supplier | String |
| Column H (STATUS) | status | String |

## Benefits
1. **Complete Data Visibility**: All information from your Google Sheets is now visible in the Products page
2. **Better Search**: You can now search by supplier or product ID in addition to product name and category
3. **Accurate Filtering**: Filter options match the actual status values in your data
4. **Consistent Display**: Status badges properly reflect the exact values in your Google Sheets

## Testing
To verify the changes:
1. Navigate to the Products page in your application
2. Confirm that all 8 data columns plus Actions column are visible
3. Test the search functionality with product names, categories, suppliers, and IDs
4. Test the filter functionality with Active and In-Active options
5. Verify that status badges correctly display Active vs In-Active

## Notes
- The minimum stock column (minStock) that was in the data mapping is not displayed in the table but is still available in the data object
- All existing functionality (editing, deleting, etc.) remains unchanged
- The data is still being fetched in real-time from your Google Sheets through your backend API
