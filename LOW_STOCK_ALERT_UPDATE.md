# Low Stock Alert Widget Update Documentation

## Overview
This document explains the changes made to the Low Stock Alert widget in the Inventory page to improve its visual appearance and consistency with the overall application theme.

## Previous Design
The previous Low Stock Alert widget had a simple yellow theme with basic styling:
- Yellow border and background
- Basic text styling
- Simple list items without visual enhancements

## New Design

   - Background: `from-red-900/30 to-orange-900/30` (gradient)
   - Added backdrop blur effect for modern glass-like appearance
   - Enhanced shadow for depth (`shadow-lg`)

2. **Header Styling**:
   - Title color: `red-300` with bold font weight
   - Alert icon: `red-400` with increased size
   - Description: `red-200/80` with medium font weight

3. **List Items**:
   - Background: `red-900/20` with backdrop blur
   - Border: `red-800/50`
   - Hover effect: `red-800/30` with smooth transition
   - Product name: `red-100` with medium font weight

   - Consistent sizing and spacing

### Visual Enhancements

## Benefits
1. **Improved Visual Hierarchy**: The red/orange theme better conveys urgency for low stock items
2. **Modern Aesthetics**: Glass morphism effects and enhanced shadows create a contemporary look
3. **Better Readability**: Font changes improve information scanning
4. **Consistent Theme**: Aligns with the application's dark theme while maintaining alert visibility
5. **Enhanced User Experience**: Hover effects and better spacing improve interaction

## Testing
To verify the changes:

4. Test hover effects on list items
5. Verify font changes and improved spacing

## Notes
