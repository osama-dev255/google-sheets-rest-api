# Inventory Page Update Documentation

## Overview
This document explains the changes made to the Inventory page to correctly display all columns from your Google Sheets Inventory sheet and fix data mapping issues.

## Previous Issues
The Inventory page had several data mapping mismatches:
1. **Last Updated** field was incorrectly mapped to column 7 (PRICE) instead of column 10
2. **Cost** field was incorrectly mapped to column 8 (LOCATION) instead of being calculated
3. **Supplier** field was incorrectly mapped to column 9 (SUPPLIER) but was using the wrong column index
4. Only a subset of available Google Sheets columns were displayed

## Data Structure in Google Sheets
Your Inventory sheet contains the following columns:
```
Column 0: ID
Column 1: PRODUCT
Column 2: CATEGORY
Column 3: CURRENTSTOCK
Column 4: RE-ORDER LEVEL (minStock)
Column 5: MAXSTOCK
Column 6: UNIT
Column 7: PRICE
Column 8: LOCATION
Column 9: SUPPLIER
Column 10: LASTUPDATED
Column 11: STATUS
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Data Mapping
Corrected the column mapping in the data processing:
- `lastUpdated`: Now correctly mapped to column 10
- `location`: Now correctly mapped to column 8
- `supplier`: Now correctly mapped to column 9
- `cost`: Now calculated as 90% of price (approximation)
- `status`: Now correctly mapped to column 11

### 2. Enhanced Table Display
The Inventory table now displays all available columns:
| Column | Field | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Product | productName | Column 1 (PRODUCT) |
| Category | category | Column 2 (CATEGORY) |
| Current Stock | currentStock | Column 3 (CURRENTSTOCK) |
| Min/Max | minStock/maxStock | Columns 4-5 (RE-ORDER LEVEL/MAXSTOCK) |
| Unit | unit | Column 6 (UNIT) |
| Price | price | Column 7 (PRICE) |
| Cost | cost | Calculated from price |
| Location | location | Column 8 (LOCATION) |
| Supplier | supplier | Column 9 (SUPPLIER) |
| Last Updated | lastUpdated | Column 10 (LASTUPDATED) |
| Status | status | Column 11 (STATUS) |

### 3. Improved Search Functionality
Search now works across all displayed fields:
- Product name
- Category
- Location
- Supplier
- Product ID

### 4. Updated Filter Options
Filter dropdown now matches actual status values:
- All Items
- Active Items
- Inactive Items

### 5. Enhanced Status Display
Status badges now properly handle:
- "Active" → Green badge
- "In-Active" → Gray badge
- "Low Stock" → Red badge
- "Out of Stock" → Secondary badge

## Benefits
1. **Complete Data Visibility**: All information from your Google Sheets is now visible
2. **Accurate Data Mapping**: No more mismatched columns
3. **Better Search**: Search across more fields
4. **Consistent Display**: Status badges properly reflect actual values
5. **Enhanced Functionality**: Low stock alerts use correct minStock values

## Testing
To verify the changes:
1. Navigate to the Inventory page in your application
2. Confirm that all 11 data columns plus Actions column are visible
3. Test the search functionality with various fields
4. Test the filter functionality with Active/Inactive options
5. Verify that low stock alerts correctly identify items below minimum levels

## Notes
- The cost field is calculated as 90% of the price as an approximation
- All existing functionality (editing, deleting, etc.) remains unchanged
- The data is still being fetched in real-time from your Google Sheets through your backend API
