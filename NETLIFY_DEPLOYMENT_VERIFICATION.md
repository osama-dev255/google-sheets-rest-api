# Netlify Deployment Verification Guide

## How to Check Deployment Status

### 1. Check Netlify Dashboard
1. Go to [Netlify Dashboard](https://app.netlify.com/)
2. Sign in to your account
3. Find your site in the list of sites
4. Check the "Deploys" tab for the latest deployment
5. Look for:
   - Green "Published" status (successful deployment)
   - Recent timestamp matching your last commit
   - No error messages in the build logs

### 2. Direct Site Access
Try accessing your site directly:
- If you know your site URL: `https://your-site-name.netlify.app`
- If you don't know it, check the Netlify dashboard "Site overview" tab

### 3. Local Build Verification
We've already verified that the build works locally:
- ✅ Build command succeeds: `npm run build` in the frontend directory
- ✅ Output files generated in `frontend/dist/` directory
- ✅ index.html and assets are present

## Common Deployment Status Indicators

### Successful Deployment
- Green "Published" badge in Netlify dashboard
- Recent deployment timestamp
- No errors in build logs
- Site is accessible via browser
- Site loads without JavaScript errors

### Failed Deployment
- Red "Failed" badge in Netlify dashboard
- Error messages in build logs
- Site returns 404 or error page
- Build process shows failures

### In Progress Deployment
- Yellow "Building" or "Deploying" badge
- Deployment timestamp shows "in progress"
- Site may be temporarily unavailable

## Troubleshooting Deployment Issues

### If Deployment Failed
1. **Check Build Logs**
   - Look for compilation errors
   - Check for missing dependencies
   - Verify environment variables

2. **Common Issues**
   - Missing or incorrect `netlify.toml` configuration
   - Incorrect base directory setting
   - Wrong build command
   - Incorrect publish directory

3. **Verify Configuration**
   ```toml
   [build]
   command = "npm run build"
   publish = "dist"
   environment = { NODE_VERSION = "18", VITE_BACKEND_URL = "https://google-sheets-rest-api-production.up.railway.app" }
   ```

### If Site is Not Accessible
1. Check DNS settings if using a custom domain
2. Verify the site URL in Netlify dashboard
3. Check if there are any redirects configured incorrectly

## Deployment Verification Checklist

### ✅ Pre-Deployment
- [x] All code changes committed and pushed to GitHub
- [x] Local build succeeds
- [x] Netlify is connected to GitHub repository
- [x] `netlify.toml` configuration is correct

### ✅ During Deployment
- [ ] Check Netlify dashboard for deployment status
- [ ] Monitor build logs for errors
- [ ] Wait for deployment to complete

### ✅ Post-Deployment
- [ ] Verify site is accessible
- [ ] Test all enhanced features:
  - Supplier field validation
  - Cost field validation
  - Error messaging
- [ ] Check browser console for errors
- [ ] Verify API integration works

## Testing the Deployed Features

### 1. Form Validation
1. Navigate to Purchases → Add Stock Through Purchase
2. Try submitting with:
   - Empty supplier field (should show error)
   - Empty cost field (should show error)
   - Invalid cost value (should show error)
   - Negative cost value (should show error)
   - All fields filled correctly (should succeed)

### 2. API Integration
1. Add a valid purchase with supplier information
2. Verify data appears in Google Sheets
3. Check both Inventory and Products sheets are updated

## Rollback Procedure
If issues are found after deployment:
1. Go to Netlify Dashboard
2. Go to "Deploys" tab
3. Find the previous working deployment
4. Click "Publish deploy"
5. Monitor for successful rollback
