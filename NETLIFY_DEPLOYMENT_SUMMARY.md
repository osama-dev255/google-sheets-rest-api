## Example Usage

### Add Stock with Supplier
```json
{
  "purchases": [
    {
      "productName": "COKE 600MLS 12S/W NP",
      "quantity": 5,
      "cost": 12.50,
      "supplier": "Coca-Cola Tanzania"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Change Supplier Only
```json
{
  "purchases": [
    {
      "productName": "COKE 600MLS 12S/W NP",
      "quantity": 0,
      "cost": 14.99,
      "supplier": "New Supplier Corporation"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues after deployment:

1. Check Netlify build logs for errors
2. Verify environment variables are correctly set
3. Ensure the backend API is accessible
4. Test the API endpoints directly to confirm functionality

## Next Steps

1. Monitor the deployment in Netlify dashboard
2. Test the live application
3. Share the URL with your team
4. Monitor for any issues in the application logs

The deployment should complete automatically since Netlify is connected to your GitHub repository. The changes will be live shortly after the build process completes.
